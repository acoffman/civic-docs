Comments
========

Encouraging a transparent curation process is one of the goals of the CIViC knowledgebase. To that end, it is possible (and encouraged) to record relevant curation details, motivivations, questions for other curators or editors in the form of comments on primary CIViC entities.

Each CIViC entity capable of accepting suggested changes also includes a comment thread. These comments can be viewed by clicking on an entity's 'Talk' tab, then the middle 'Comments' tab that will appear beneath the entity summary. 

Initial Comments
----------------
The forms for adding new evidence or assertions includes a comment field, intended to include a note from the curator describing why the record should be included in CIViC. This comment will be displayed at the top of the comment thread. Note that this comment is not required so many records will not include an initial comment.

Creating Comments
-----------------
To create a comment, ensure you are logged in, navigate to the entity you wish to comment upon, click the entity's Talk tab, then the Comments tab. At the bottom of the page, there will be displayed a textarea in which you may enter your comment.

Above the comment area are two buttons, 'Compose' and 'Preview', with Compose being selected by default. Click Preview to see how your message will appear with all the formatting and links applied.

When you are satisfied with your comment, press 'Submit Comment', and your message will be immediately appended to the entity's comment thread.
