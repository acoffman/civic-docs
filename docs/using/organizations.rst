Organizations
=============

Users may be included in Organizations, primarily in order to keep track of an organization's contributions to CIViC curation. A User's group affiliation is displayed in their profile and user card.

Joining Organizations
---------------------
Currently, an administrator must assign a user to a group. To request joining a group, send an email to admin@civicdb.org.

Finding Organizations
---------------------
The CIViC Community page includes a Organizations page that shows organization leaderboards and a search interface where users may locate a specific organization by filtering on its name.
