Users and Groups
================

CIViC users have one of three roles: curator, editor and admin. Curators may submit evidence, assertions, and source suggestions. They may also submit suggested changes to all entities. Editors may do everything that curators do, plus approve and reject items submitted by curators. Admins have access to the CIViC server admin console and may crate/modify users, groups, and other administrative tasks available only via the admin console.
