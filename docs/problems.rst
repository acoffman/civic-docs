Report a Problem
================

If you discover a bug or something isn't working quite right, we want to know
about it! Please `submit an issue to the civic-client github project
<https://github.com/genome/civic-client/issues>`_. We
monitor these issues closely and will be able to collaborate on getting the
problem resolved quickly.

If for some reason you do not wish to use github you may `send an email to the civic-help email list <mailto:help@civicdb.org?subject=CIViC\ Help\ Request>`_, to which CIViC developers and researchers are all
subscribed.

We'd prefer to use Github for handling bugs, since the resolution to any issue
will be public for anyone to see and benefit from.
