Statement
=========

- Evidence Statements should be:

  - derived from primary literature sources (not review articles) whenever possible.
  - as concise as possible while providing sufficient experiemental detail to interpret and evaluate the evidence (N values, statistics, etc).
  - a single Predictive, Predisposing, Diagnostic or Prognostic assertion, not a combination.
  - aimed at a general audience, avoiding field-specific acronyms and colloquialisms.

- Multiple, separate Evidence Items can be and often are derived from a single publication.
- Generally, assertions involving drugs should be classified as being of the Predictive Evidence Type.
- Star Ratings should be based on the strength of the specific assertion. Multiple assertions from the same publication can have different star ratings.
