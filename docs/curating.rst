Curating CIViC
==============

CIViC curators are a community of users dedicated to improving the CIViC
knowledgebase and its contents.

Prerequisites:

- Create an account. Creating an account requires only that you have login
  creditials for one of our supported OAuth providers (currently Google, ORCiD,
  or GitHub).

Although curators are not required to have any specific training, background
or skill set, curator-generated content can only be "Accepted" once it is
reviewed by a CIViC Editor. Editors are experts in cancer genomics, oncology,
pathology and other relevant fields. This gate-keeper model allows significant
contributions from curators with any level of experience while maintaining the
quality of an expert-driven resource. Curators can be promoted to Editors once
they have demonstrated sufficient understanding of the CIViC data model and
requirements for cancer variant interpretation.

Even small contributions can make a big impact on how up-to-date and
comprehensive the CIViC resource is. Examples of small curation activities
include: commenting on existing entries, identifying additional literature
sources, improving the wording of a variant interpretation, adding variant IDs
or aliases, etc.
