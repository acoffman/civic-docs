Introduction to CIViC
=====================

To get started using and contributing to CIViC, we recommend that you :ref:`review the Video Tutorials below <tutorials>`. These videos cover
CIViC and its goals, finding documentation and help resources, browsing and
searching knowledgebase contents, adding evidence to CIViC, and editing CIViC
evidence.

For a primer on the fundamentals of cancer variant interpretation, we highly
recommend that new users start by reading the CIViC paper and four recently
published Standards and Guidelines proposals:

- `CIViC is a community knowledgebase for expert crowdsourcing the clinical
  interpretation of variants in cancer.
  <http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v49/n2/full/ng.3774.html>`_
- `ACMG/AMP - Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence
  variants. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741868>`_
- `ClinGen - Somatic cancer variant curation and harmonization through consensus
  minimum variant level data (MVLD).
  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27814769>`_
- `AMP/ASCO/CAP - Standards and guidelines for the interpretation and reporting
  of sequence variants in cancer. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993330>`_
- `Evaluating the Clinical Validity of Gene-Disease Associations: An
  Evidence-Based Framework Developed by the Clinical Genome Resource
  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552198>`_
- `Standardized decision support in next generation sequencing reports of somatic
  cancer variants <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768039>`_

The CIViC Ecosystem of Collaborators, Moderators, and Other Stakeholders
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CIViC project aims to facilitate a collaborative ecosystem of research
scientists, clinical scientists, and patient advocates dedicated to curating
an accurate and relevant database of clinical interpretations of cancer
variants. The diagram below shows how the various stakeholders in the CIViC
ecosystem collaborate to curate the database.
