The BC Cancer Agency's Personalized Onco-Genomics (POG) program is a clinical research initiative that is embedding genomic sequencing into real-time treatment planning for BC patients with incurable cancers. Cancer is a complex biological process. We categorize cancers according to their site of origin (e.g. lung, breast, liver, colon) as each one is different, but even within these groupings there are subtypes with differences in response to treatment and overall behaviour. The POG program is a collaborative research study including many BCCA oncologists, pathologists and other clinicians along with the Genome Sciences Centre (GSC), which aims to decode the genome – the entire DNA and RNA inside the cell – of each patient's cancer, to understand what is enabling it to grow. Using this genomic data in clinical decision-making should allow us to develop treatment strategies to block its growth, identify clinical trials that the patient may benefit from and potentially identify less toxic and more effective therapeutic options.

To widen the reach and visibility of CIViC, and to enable its use as a valuable resource to the community of diagnostic labs, a partnership was set up with Agilent Technologies and the CIViC database has been integrated into their Cartagenia Bench Lab NGS software platform. This cloud-based, clinical-grade software platform is geared towards routine diagnostic labs and allows molecular pathologists to automate their variant filtration and classification workflow, and draft lab reports. As of version 5.0 of Bench Lab, labs can automate their variant assessment protocol to assess the molecular profile of a sample and automatically flag presence of prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic evidence in the CIViC database. Users are able to restrict the CIViC search to relevant tumor and tissue type. Secondly, the variant review tools in the platform now allow users to review the CIViC content and assess and select relevant portions for inclusion into draft lab reports.
