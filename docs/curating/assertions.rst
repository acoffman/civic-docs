Curating Assertions
===================
The CIViC Assertion (AID) functions as a summary of a body of evidence in the form of CIViC Evidence Items (EIDs) for a particular CIViC Variant. The Assertion also brings the unique function of incorporating information from practice guidelines (e.g. NCCN) and also integrating widely adopted clinical tiering systems (e.g. AMP-ASCO-CAP (`Li et al. 2017 <https://paperpile.com/c/hW1INu/jFZK>`__) and ACMG-AMP (`Richards et al. 2015 <https://paperpile.com/c/hW1INu/n8Pq>`__).
