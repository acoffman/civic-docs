Suggesting Sources
------------------

All curated CIViC Evidence, Assertions, Variant Summaries, and Gene Summaries are based on cited sources from the biomedical literature, currently limited to those publications indexed in PubMed or the ASCO Meeting Library. As soon as any publication is cited in CIViC it appears as a separate Source Record and can be browsed or searched within the CIViC knowledgebase. Each Source Record includes details about the publication as well as a table linking to all CIViC evidence curated for that source. Comments can be added to any Source Record at any time. Source comments are a useful place to document general or specific notes to aid current and future curation. For example, if a source has an overlapping patient population with another study already curated within CIViC, this can be documented. In other cases, the reference sequence used for determining variant coordinates might be recorded. 

It is also possible to directly submit a “Source Suggestion” for future consideration and curation. This is one of the simplest curation tasks. A curator simply accesses the Add -> Source Suggestion form, selects a Source Type (PubMed or ASCO) and then enters a PubMed ID or ASCO Abstract Number. A comment must be included describing the relevance of this source to CIViC and any additional details that might be relevant during subsequent curation of the source. Optionally a curator may also “pre-curate” the Gene Name, Variant Name, and Disease described by the source. More than one Source Suggestion can be made for a single source. For example, multiple lines of evidence might be proposed for curation for multiple genes, variants or diseases from the same publication. Once a Source Suggestion has been submitted it can be accessed from the `Source Suggestion Queue <https://civicdb.org/curation/sources>`_ or from the individual Source Record Page for that source. Each Source Suggestion can be curated using the ‘Add Evidence Item’ action, which activates the Add Evidence form and pre-populates with any gene, variant or disease details pre-curated for the source. After each Source Suggestions has been curated curators can use the “Mark Suggestion as Curated” action. Once all Source Suggestions for a Source have been marked as curated, the Source itself attains a status of “Fully Curated”. Finally, if upon review the Source Suggestion is not determined to be suitable for curation in CIViC it can be rejected using the “Reject Suggestion” action. CIViC curators and editors are encouraged to use Source Comments and Source Suggestions for overall management of curation projects and activities.
