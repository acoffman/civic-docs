.. rubric:: The Cancer Analysis Bottleneck

With the recent advent of rapid and affordable tumor genome sequencing, interpreting the clinical significance of cancer variants from the wealth of existing and rapidly evolving medical literature has become a major bottleneck to realizing the potential of precision cancer medicine.

Associating cancer variants with concrete clinical actions by manual curation of high quality evidence is a great challenge. Creating useful interpretations requires integrating complex information from diverse sources ranging from preclinical lab experiments to clinical trial results. Creating and maintaining such interpretations will require the concerted effort of many experts at a large scale.

.. rubric:: Cancer Variant Interpretation - Evidence Statements, Variant Summaries and Gene Summaries

For a primer on the fundamentals of cancer variant interpretation, we highly recommend that new users start by reading the CIViC paper and three recently published Standards and Guidelines proposals:

- `CIViC is a community knowledgebase for expert crowdsourcing the clinical
  interpretation of variants in cancer.
  <http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v49/n2/full/ng.3774.html>`_
- `ACMG/AMP - Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence
  variants. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741868>`_
- `ClinGen - Somatic cancer variant curation and harmonization through
  consensus minimum variant level data (MVLD).
  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27814769>`_
- `AMP/ASCO/CAP - Standards and guidelines for the interpretation and
  reporting of sequence variants in cancer.
