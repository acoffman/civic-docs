Understanding Trust Ratings
---------------------------
Pellentesque dapibus suscipit ligula.  Donec posuere augue in quam.  Etiam vel tortor sodales tellus ultricies commodo.  Suspendisse potenti.  Aenean in sem ac leo mollis blandit.  Donec neque quam, dignissim in, mollis nec, sagittis eu, wisi.  Phasellus lacus.  Etiam laoreet quam sed arcu.  Phasellus at dui in ligula mollis ultricies.  Integer placerat tristique nisl.  Praesent augue.  Fusce commodo.  Vestibulum convallis, lorem a tempus semper, dui dui euismod elit, vitae placerat urna tortor vitae lacus.  Nullam libero mauris, consequat quis, varius et, dictum id, arcu.  Mauris mollis tincidunt felis.  Aliquam feugiat tellus ut neque.  Nulla facilisis, risus a rhoncus fermentum, tellus tellus lacinia purus, et dictum nunc justo sit amet elit.

Curating Trust Ratings
----------------------
In order to quickly discern how much trust curators and users have in a single evidence statement, a five star trust rating system is used. Each evidence item is given a rating, from 1 to 5 stars, based on the quality of the evidence the statement summarizes. This rating depends on a number of factors, including journal impact, study size, quality control, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility. It should be noted that this rating is largely subjective and may be debated (hopefully within the CIViC interface). Also the rating should be specific to the evidence statement. The overall publication/study might be high quality in a high impact publication, but the evidence statement may refer to a single conclusion in the study, and that part of the study might not be well supported. For example, the assertion may relate to patients with a particular mutation, and the study might involve an impressive 500 patients, but if only 2 patients have the mutation in question, the quality rating may be low for this evidence statement.

   * - Trust Rating
     - Definition
   * - |star| |star| |star| |star| |star|
     - Strong, well supported evidence from a lab or journal with respected academic standing. Experiments are well controlled, and results are clean and reproducible across multiple replicates. Evidence confirmed using independent methods. The study is statistically well powered.
   * - |star| |star| |star| |star| |star-o|
     - Strong, well supported evidence. Experiments are well controlled, and results are convincing. Any discrepancies from expected results are well-explained and not concerning.
   * - |star| |star| |star| |star-o| |star-o|
     - Evidence is convincing, but not supported by a breadth of experiments. May be smaller scale projects, or novel results without many follow-up experiments. Discrepancies from expected results are explained and not concerning.
   * - |star| |star| |star-o| |star-o| |star-o|
     - Evidence is not well supported by experimental data, and little follow-up data is available. Publication is from a journal with low academic impact. Experiments may lack proper controls, have small sample size, or are not statistically convincing.
   * - |star| |star-o| |star-o| |star-o| |star-o|
     - Claim is not supported well by experimental evidence. Results are not reproducible, or have very small sample size. No follow-up is done to validate novel claims.
