=======
The Variant Name describes the specific variant being interpreted for clinical utility. Clicking on a variant name in the variant list for a gene will bring up a variant specific page with description, coordinates, alises, and associated Evidence Items.

You may enter a new variant not included in the CIViC database, but be aware that a new Variant record will be created. Please review the :ref:`Variant Name documentation <variant-name>` to learn more about how variant names are structured before you enter a new Variant name.
