Variant
=======
The Variant Name describes the specific variant being interpreted for clinical utility. Clicking on a variant name in the variant list for a gene will bring up a variant specific page with description, coordinates, aliases, and associated Evidence Items.

When curating an Evidence Item you may enter an existing Variant Name or specify a new Variant Name not already included in the CIViC database, in which case a new Variant record will be created. Please review the :ref:`Variant Name documentation <variant-name>` to learn more about how variant names are structured before you enter a new Variant Name.
