Direction
=========
Evidence Direction indicates if the Evidence Statement supports or refutes the clinical significance of an event. 

Understanding Evidence Direction
--------------------------------
The available options include: “Supports” or “Does not support”. Nuanced examples for how to correctly use the Evidence Direction for Predictive Evidence Types are shown in the :ref:`section on curating Evidence Items <curating-evidence>`. Note that Predisposing and Oncogenic Evidence do not have an Evidence Direction or Clinical Significance. These should be established at the assertion level using the appropriate guidelines. This is also discussed in the section on curating Evidence Items in the link above.

Curating Evidence Direction
--------------------------------
Evidence Direction interpretation differs slightly depending on the Evidence Type.
