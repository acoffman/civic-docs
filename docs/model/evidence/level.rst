Understanding Levels
--------------------
Pellentesque dapibus suscipit ligula.  Donec posuere augue in quam.  Etiam vel tortor sodales tellus ultricies commodo.  Suspendisse potenti.  Aenean in sem ac leo mollis blandit.  Donec neque quam, dignissim in, mollis nec, sagittis eu, wisi.  Phasellus lacus.  Etiam laoreet quam sed arcu.  Phasellus at dui in ligula mollis ultricies.  Integer placerat tristique nisl.  Praesent augue.  Fusce commodo.  Vestibulum convallis, lorem a tempus semper, dui dui euismod elit, vitae placerat urna tortor vitae lacus.  Nullam libero mauris, consequat quis, varius et, dictum id, arcu.  Mauris mollis tincidunt felis.  Aliquam feugiat tellus ut neque.  Nulla facilisis, risus a rhoncus fermentum, tellus tellus lacinia purus, et dictum nunc justo sit amet elit.

Curating Levels
---------------
Each evidence statement is the result of an experiment, trial or study in published literature. It is important to capture the nature of these experiments in the evidence entry. Evidence levels allow for the subject of an evidence item to be presented in a simple, standardized fashion. The evidence level is also an indication of how close each assertion is to actual application in the clinic. Please, note that while evidence statements of all levels are acceptable in CIViC, by far the highest priority are levels A and B, followed by C, D, E. Our top priority is to document the evidence for application of variant interpretations to real patients in the clinic today. The more time and development needed to determine the relevance of a variant to real patients in the clinic, the lower the priority for curation. Reviewing and approving evidence items requires a serious time committment by the community. Please keep this in mind and try to direct your efforts to the most immediately clinically relevant evidence first.

   * - Level
     - Name
     - Definition
     - Example and further comments
   * - :green:`A`
     - :green:`Validated association`
     - Proven/consensus association in human medicine.
     - *"AML with mutated NPM1" is a provisional entity in WHO classification of acute
       myeloid leukemia (AML). This mutation should be tested for in
       clinical trials and is recommended for testing in patients with
       cytogenetically normal AML.* Validated associations are often in
       routine clinical practice already or are the subject of major
       clinical trial efforts.
   * - :blue:`B`
     - :blue:`Clinical evidence`
     - Clinical trial or other primary patient data
       supports association.
     - *BRAF V600E is correlated with poor
       prognosis in papillary thyroid cancer in a study of 187 patients
       with PTC and other thyroid diseases.* The evidence should be
       supported by observations in multiple patients. Additional support
       from functional data is desirable but not required.
   * - :purple:`C`
     - :purple:`Case study`
     - Individual case reports from clinical journals.
     - *A single patient with FLT3 over-expression responded to the FLT3
       inhibitor sunitinib.* The study may have involved a large number of
       patients, but the statement was supported by only a single
       patient. In some cases, observations from just a handful of
       patients (e.g. 2-3) or a single family may also be considered a
       case study/report.
   * - :orange:`D`
     - :orange:`Preclinical evidence`
     - In vivo or in vitro models support association.
     - *Experiments showed that AG1296 is effective in
       triggering apoptosis in cells with the FLT3 internal tandem
       duplication.* The study may have involved some patient data, but
       support for this statement was limited to in vivo or in vitro
       models (e.g. mouse studies, cell lines, molecular assays, etc.).
   * - :red:`E`
     - :red:`Inferential association`
     - Indirect evidence.
     - *CD33 and CD123 expression were significantly increased in patients with NPM1
       mutation with FLT3-ITD, indicating these patients may respond to
       combined anti-CD33 and anti-CD123 therapy.* The assertion is at
       least one step removed from a direct association between a variant
       and clinical relevance.
