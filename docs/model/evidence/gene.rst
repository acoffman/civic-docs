The Gene Name identifies the gene implicated by the evidence item.

Curating Genes
--------------
A Gene Name is a required field for Evidence Item submission. The CIViC Gene Name utilizes the HGNC official gene symbol as provided by Entrez, where applicable, which are approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). The Gene Name field will auto-fill using type-ahead search for genes in the Entrez database or their associated Aliases. Curators must enter a valid Entrez Gene Name (e.g., TP53) and should verify the correct entry against the Entrez Gene ID automatically displayed by the CIViC interface. Alternative Gene Names (Aliases/Synonyms) are imported from Entrez and are searchable throughout the database.
