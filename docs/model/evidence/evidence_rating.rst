Evidence Rating
===============
The Evidence Rating is scored on a scale from 1-5 stars reflecting the curator’s confidence in the quality of the summarized evidence.

Understanding Evidence Ratings
---------------------------
The Evidence Rating is scored on a scale from 1-5 stars reflecting the Curator’s confidence in the quality of the summarized evidence. This rating depends on a number of factors, including study size, study design, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility. Although the overall publication/study/abstract might be high quality, the Evidence Rating may be low for an Evidence Item referring to a single conclusion in the study that is not well supported. The Evidence rating therefore does not rate the journal, publication, or Evidence Source itself, but instead evaluates in isolation the components of evidence extracted from the Evidence Source. While this remains a somewhat subjective measure, general best-practices for the Evidence Rating are detailed below.

Curating Evidence Ratings
----------------------
In order to quickly discern how well the evidence derived from the pubmed or abstract evidence source supports a given evidence statement, a five star evidence rating system is used. Each evidence item is given a rating, from 1 to 5 stars, based on the quality of the evidence the statement summarizes. This rating depends on a number of factors, including study size, quality control, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility. It should be noted that this rating is largely subjective and may be debated (hopefully within the CIViC interface). Also the rating should be specific to the evidence statement. The overall publication/study might be high quality, but the evidence statement may refer to a single conclusion in the study, and that part of the study might not be well supported. For example, the assertion may relate to patients with a particular mutation, and the study might involve an impressive 500 patients, but if only 2 patients have the mutation in question, the quality rating may be low for this evidence statement.

   * - Evidence Rating
     - Definition
   * - |star| |star| |star| |star| |star|
     - Strong, well supported evidence from a lab or journal with respected academic standing. Experiments are well controlled, and results are clean and reproducible across multiple replicates. Evidence confirmed using independent methods. The study is statistically well powered.
   * - |star| |star| |star| |star| |star-o|
     - Strong, well supported evidence. Experiments are well controlled, and results are convincing. Any discrepancies from expected results are well-explained and not concerning.
   * - |star| |star| |star| |star-o| |star-o|
     - Evidence is convincing, but not supported by a breadth of experiments. May be smaller scale projects, or novel results without many follow-up experiments. Discrepancies from expected results are explained and not concerning.
   * - |star| |star| |star-o| |star-o| |star-o|
     - Evidence is not well supported by experimental data, and little follow-up data is available. Publication is from a journal with low academic impact. Experiments may lack proper controls, have small sample size, or are not statistically convincing.
   * - |star| |star-o| |star-o| |star-o| |star-o|
     - Claim is not supported well by experimental evidence. Results are not reproducible, or have very small sample size. No follow-up is done to validate novel claims.

.. rubric:: Example: Five Star Evidence Rating
The example Evidence Item below describes a Phase III clinical trial (PROFILE 1014) that evaluated the impact of the ALK - Fusions variant on therapeutic response with crizotinib for patients with lung non-small cell carcinoma. The clinical trial was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-control study of 343 patients that evaluated progression free survival, objective response rate, and quality of life. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
