At the heart of CIViC is the clinical evidence statement. The clinical
evidence statement is a piece of information that has been manually curated
from trustable medical literature about a variant or genomic 'event' that has
implications in cancer predisposition, diagnosis (aka molecular
classification), prognosis, or predictive response to therapy. For example,
"Patients with BRAF V600 mutations respond well to the drug dabrafenib". A
variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or
deletion, an RNA gene fusion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA expression
pattern (e.g. over-expression), etc. Each clinical evidence statement
corresponds to a single citable publication. Ready to jump into the

or visit the `Source Suggestion queue <https://civicdb.org/curation/sources>`_ for inspiration.
