Variant Groups
==============

Variant groups allow users to group variants from a single gene or multiple
genes that have similar clinical consequences.

Example uses:

- Variants that confer resistance to a class of drugs
- Variants with strong data to support a very similar effect on protein function
  (e.g., loss-of-function, activating)
- Variants that can be effectively combined when considering patient
  outcomes/treatment

.. rubric:: Create a Variant Group

Users with Editor or Admin roles are allowed to create a new Variant
Group. To create a new Variant Group use the “Add Variant Group” button
below the list of Variants on any Gene/Variant page. Multiple Variants
from multiple Genes may then be added by using the + button next to the
Variant field. Note that a Variant must exist in CIViC in order to be
added to a Variant Group. To exist, a Variant must have at least one
Evidence Statement. You can add a new Variant by creating a new Evidence
Item using the Add Evidence form.

.. rubric:: Add to a Variant Group

Variants can be added to a Variant Group by using the ‘edit’ function of
a Variant Group.
