Assertions
==========
An assertion classifies the clinical significance of a variant-disease associate under recognized guidelines.

This section of the documentation details the knowledge model that CIViC uses for representing assertions. Each page roughly corresponds to a field in the Assertion schema. Note that Assertions share several key fields with Evidence Items, listed on the :ref:`Shared Fields page <assertions-shared-fields>` along with notes regarding differences in the meaning of those fields between the two entities.
