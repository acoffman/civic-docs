My Variant Info
===============
After manual coordinate curation for a variant, a specifically formatted coordinate expression is automatically generated and used to query myvariant.info. A selected set of `MyVariant.info <https://myvariant.info>`__ fields are retrieved and displayed on the CIViC variant page, which also includes links to ClinVar, COSMIC and OMIM variant pages. Note that this ClinVar link is in addition to hand curated ClinVar IDs which are also an editable field on the CIViC Variant. MyVariant details also include HGVS expressions which may be used to convert the variant between different genome builds.

This information is automatically extracted from the MyVariant.info database, and is not curated.
