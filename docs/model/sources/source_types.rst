Source Types
============

Each Evidence Item must be associated with a Source Type and Source ID. These data link the Evidence Item to the original publication supporting clinical claims.

PubMed Sources
--------------

For publications indexed on PubMed, the Source ID will be the PubMed ID. The PubMed ID can be found by searching the publication on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/.

ASCO Sources
------------

For American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Sources, the Source ID will be the ASCO Web ID. Of note, the ASCO Web ID is not the ASCO abstract number. The ASCO Web ID is the identification number found in the URL of the abstract.
