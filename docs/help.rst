Get Help
========

The best way to get help is by posting a `question on BioStars <https://www.biostars.org/t/civic/>`_ and tagging it
with 'civic'. Several members of the team monitor BioStars carefully and will
respond to your query.

Alternatively, you may `send an email to the civic-help email list <mailto:help@civicdb.org?subject=CIViC\ Help\ Request>`_, to which
CIViC developers and researchers are all subscribed.

We'd prefer to use BioStars for technical support, since the resolution to any
issue will be public for anyone to see and benefit from.
