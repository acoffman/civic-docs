.. rubric:: Advancing Cancer Precision Medicine with Community Collaboration

Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated, and interpreted for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance of cancer genome alterations. For more details and to cite CIViC please refer to the `CIViC publication <http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v49/n2/full/ng.3774.html>`_ in Nature Genetics.

.. rubric:: How our Collaborative Process is Different

All content created in CIViC is, and will continue to be, freely available, without restriction with a `Public Domain License <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`_. Anyone can contribute to CIViC by simply registering for an account. Users join the community with "Curator" level privileges that allow them to comment or propose additions or revisions on any knowledge in CIViC. Proposed additions and revisions are then reviewed by users with "Editor" level privileges before entering the public CIViC record. Community curators work together with editors towards comprehensive and accurate interpretations of the clinical relevance of variants in cancer.

.. rubric:: Contributing to CIViC

CIViC provides an open forum for community contributions. Anyone can create an account to flag problems, add comments, propose revisions to existing content, or submit new evidence, assertions, or summaries. All proposed additions/revisions enter a pending state until considered for approval by a CIViC editor. All content contributed and accepted is immediately considered public domain knowledge. For more details on how to contribute please read our :doc:`curating <curating>` docs.

.. rubric:: Using CIViC Data

CIViC is intended to provide an educational resource to support better understanding of the current state of precision medicine. It may also provide useful summaries and links to relevant published evidence for the clinical relevance of specific variants. With appropriate validation (e.g., in a CLIA certified, CAP accredited environment) it may also be used to develop panels or software for variant interpretation in a clinical diagnostic setting. However, direct use of the CIViC application/website is intended for purely research purposes. It should not be used for emergencies or medical or professional advice.

We provide CIViC data freely to all under the `Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication, CC0 1.0 Universal License <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`_. Data can be `downloaded in bulk <https://civicdb.org/releases>`_ as tab-separated files or accessed through our fully open and :doc:`documented API <api>`.
