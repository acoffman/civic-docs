Variants
========

The variants endpoint allows users to enumerate all of the variants present in CIViC as well as retrieve more detailed information on a specific variant. A common use case would be to get a list of variants for a gene using the genes endpoint and then fetching detailed information for each variant via the variants endpoint.

Get a list of variants
----------------------

This endpoint returns a listing of variants in CIViC that contain at least one evidence item. This index style endpoint is `paginated` by default. You can use the ``count`` and ``page`` parameters or the ``previous`` and ``next`` links to iterate through all the variants.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.",
