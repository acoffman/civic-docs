When curating evidence statements from published sources, to discern whether a variant has a "clinical interpretation", we use the data model below. Evidence statements describe how a variant was demonstrated to (1) be predictive of drug response, (2) be correlated with prognostic outcome, (3) be of diagnostic utility in determining cancer subtype (aka molecular classification), or (4) predispose a person to a type of cancer. If an evidence item can not be placed in one of these four categories (Predictive, Prognostic, Diagnostic, Predisposing), it likely lies outside of the scope of CIViC. However, published statements about a gene or variant that cannot be placed within these categories can still be added to the gene and variant summaries.
