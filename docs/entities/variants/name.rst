.. rubric:: General Guidelines

- New Variant Names should be unique within the gene of interest.
  Otherwise, an Evidence Item should be assigned to the existing Variant
  for that gene. Before proposing a new variant, please check existing
  variants to prevent redundancy. For example, 'deletion' and 'loss'.
- The Variant Name should be the most specific possible given the
  literature citation (i.e., V600E over V600). In general the convention is
  to use the protein representation where possible (instead of the cDNA or
  genome representation).
- The Variant Name may:

  - be a specific animo acid change (e.g., V600E or W288fs).
  - encompass more than 1 type of genomic change (e.g., Exon 12 Mutations or
    Frameshift Truncation).
  - share the same name as a variant in another gene (e.g., G12D is a Variant
    Name for both KRAS and NRAS).

- For fusions:

  - The Variant Name is always 5' partner - 3' partner.
  - The fusion variant is entered under only one gene. Choose the 'important'
    gene. Often, but not always, this is the 3' gene. (e.g., the BCR-ABL
    Variant is associated with ABL1 Gene)
